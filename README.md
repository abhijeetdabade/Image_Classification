# Image Classification with ResNet-50

## Description
This project performs image classification using the ResNet-50 model pre-trained on ImageNet. It classifies images into different categories by utilizing a deep learning model based on transfer learning.

## Installation
To run this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the Jupyter notebook to train and test the ResNet-50 model:
